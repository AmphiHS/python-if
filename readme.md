# Python Portfolio - If-Statements

## Project Overview
You will be developing a series of programs to demonstrate your knowledge of <b>If Statements</b> and <b>Boolean Operations</b>. Many of these programs focus on the underlying logic rather than making flashy visuals and extensive apps. You will be completing several programs of your choosing, ultimately creating a portfolio of different apps that demonstrate your knowledge.

Your goal is to earn <b>20 points</b>. You earn these points by completing your choice of programs that are categorized as <b>starter, standard, and challenge</b> with each program being worth a different number of points. This allows you to choose which programs to complete and in what order, but you must earn at least 20 points to earn full credit.

As you complete your programs, you will also keep a daily Programming Journal (also attached to this assignment). You will use this to keep track of your progress and reflect on how things are going. This will also factor into your grade for this assignment.

## How To Earn Points
Each <b>Starter</b> program is worth <b>2 points</b>. There are Five Starter programs to choose from.<br />
Each <b>Standard</b> program is worth <b>5 points</b>. There are Two Standard programs to choose from.<br />
Each <b>Challenge</b> program is worth <b>10 points</b>. There are Three Challenge programs to choose from.

You have your choice of which programs to complete, but you must earn at least 20 points total. This gives you several options. Here are a few examples (but there are many others):
-	You could complete all five Starter programs (10 points) and both Standard programs (10 points)
-	You could complete both Standard programs and a Challenge program (10 points)
-	You could complete two Challenge programs (20 points)

You can earn up to 5 points in Extra Credit if you end up going “over” the 20 point limit. For example, if you complete two Challenge programs and a Standard program, you can earn 25/20 points. Anything above 25 won’t earn you any additional points.

## Getting Your Programs Checked
To get your programs checked, put up your <b>Green Stoplight</b> and Schneider will come over to check your program. We’ll run the program at your computer and check a few test-cases to make sure everything works correctly. If so, Schneider will check it off on a clipboard he has and you can move onto the next program. You can get multiple programs checked at the same time if you want to wait and get several checked at once.

While you’re waiting to get programs checked, you can start working on the next program you plan to complete.
